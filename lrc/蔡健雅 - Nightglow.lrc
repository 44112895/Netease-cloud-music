[00:02.20]The way I go through with red roses burn my eyes
[00:14.19]
[00:14.87]Cold rain starts pouring hard I&apos;m being called upon
[00:26.27]Never let you go it&apos;s why I did them all
[00:32.86]For a chance at least to live in your way
[00:40.08]Love of you is my most cherished thing
[00:46.72]So stay alive bravely
[01:19.92]I wish I could wake from the dream each time I dream
[01:32.65]There&apos;s a long night coming soon I&apos;d shine as the last shine
[01:43.70]Never let you go it&apos;s why I did them all
[01:50.64]For a chance at least to live in your way
[01:57.90]Love of you is my most cherished thing
[02:04.66]So stay alive bravely
[02:22.61]Never let you go it&apos;s why I did them all
[02:29.50]For a chance at least to live in your way
[02:36.87]Love of you is my most cherished thing
[02:43.32]So stay alive bravely
